\item An LC circuit contains a $50 \mu H$ inductor and a $50 \mu F$ capacitor with an initial charge of $10 mC$. The resistance of the circuit is negligible. Let the instant the circuit is closed by $t = 0$.

\textbf{a)} What is the total energy stored initially? Is it conserved during LC oscillations?

\textbf{b)} What is the natural frequency of the circuit?

\textbf{c)} At what time is the energy stored \textbf{(i)} completely electrical (i.e., stored in the capacitor)? \textbf{(ii)} completely magnetic (i.e., stored in the inductor)?

\textbf{d)} At what times is the total energy shared equally between the inductor and the capacitor?

\textbf{e)} If a resistor is inserted in the circuit, how much energy is eventually dissipated as heat? \\
