\item A simple pendulum of length $l$ and having a bob of mass $M$ is suspended in a car. The car is moving in a circular track of radius $R$ with a uniform speed $v$. If the pendulum makes small oscillations in a radial direction about its equilibrium position, what will be its time period?

\item A spring balance has a scale that that reads from $0$ to $50$ kg.The length of the scale is 20 cm.A body is suspended from this balance,when displaced and released, oscillates with a period of 0.6 s.What is weight of the body?

\item A parallel beam of light with a wavelength of $500$ nm falls on a narrow slit, and the resulting diffraction pattern is observed on a screen $1$ m away. The distance to the first minimum from the center of the screen is $2.5$ mm.Find the width of the slit given that $y = 0.0025$ m, $L = 1$ m, and $\lambda = 5 \times 10^{-7}$ m.\\
