        \brak 1 $A(x)$ should be a function of position x, and it can be expressed as $A(x)=A_{0}cos(\omega t+\alpha)$ where $A_{0}$ is a constant, $k$ is the wavenumber, $x$ is the position and $\alpha$ is a phase constant. & 
        \brak 1 $A(x)$ should be a constant, and it can be expressed as $A(x)=A_{0}$ where $A_{0}$ is a constant number. \\ \hline

        \brak 2 $\phi (x)$ can be expressed as $\phi (x)=c$ where c is a constant. &
