\item You are riding in an automobile of mass 3000 kg. Assuming that you are examining the oscillation characteristics of its suspension system. The suspension sags 15 cm when the entire automobile is placed on it. Also, the amplitude of oscillation decreases by 50\% during one complete oscillation. Estimate the values of
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
    \item The spring constant \( K \)
    \item The damping constant \( b \) for the spring and shock absorber system of one wheel, assuming that each wheel supports 750 kg.
