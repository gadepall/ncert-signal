title: Question 11.9.1.2

Given the terms of the sequence are represented by 
a subscript n = n/n+1

The first five terms of the sequence are obtained by putting n=1,2,3,4,5 respectively

a subscript 1= 1/2
a subscript 2= 2/3
a subscript 3= 3/4
a subscript 4= 4/5
a subscript 5= 5/6

Now,
\begin{align*}
    x(n) = 
    \begin{cases}
        u(n) -\frac{u(n)}{n+1} & \text{if }n \geq 0\\
        \text{not defined } & \text{if }n <0
    \end{cases}
\end{align*}\\
